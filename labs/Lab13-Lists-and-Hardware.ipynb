    "## Task 0\n",
    "For this lab, we are going to solve of mix of standard tasks, as well as tasks that utilize hardware. The hardware we are going to play with is a combination of an [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/) [Fadecandy](https://learn.adafruit.com/assets/12274) microcontroller and a [8x8 LED NeoPixel matrix](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1487). The Fadecandy/LED matrix hardware/software is a DIY (do it yourself) project that is available through Adafruit at [this site](https://learn.adafruit.com/led-art-with-fadecandy). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "1. If for some reason you are unable to get the necessary software installed and working properly, *pair up with someone or work on tasks from Lab 12.*\n",
    "1. Please **be gentle** with the hardware, especially the wires and the connection points\n",
    "1. Please **do not turn the lights on full brightness**. It is incredibly bright! To programmatically dim the lights, use less intense RGB values for your colors. For example, let `brightness = 50`:\n",
    "    1. `white = (brightness, brightness, brightness)` instead of `white = (255, 255, 255)`\n",
    "    1. `red = (brightness, 0, 0)` instead of `red = (255, 0, 0)`\n",
    "    1. `green = (0, brightness, 0)` instead of `green = (0, 255, 0)`\n",
    "    1. `blue = (0, 0, brightness)` instead of `blue = (0, 0, 255)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can explore RGB color values at [this website](http://www.colorpicker.com/).\n",

    "The following steps for Task 0 are going to walk you through downloading and installing the necessary software to program the Fadecandy micro-controller with Python :) I would like to give credit to this [Adafruit project page](https://learn.adafruit.com/led-art-with-fadecandy) for information about the hardware/software setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Fadecandy Hardware\n",
    "We are going to utilize the following hardware:\n",
    "1. Fadecandy micro-controller\n",

    "1. Mini USB cable\n",
    "1. 5V power supply\n",
    "\n",
    "To setup the hardware, perform the following steps:\n",
    "1. Gently plug the USB cable into the Fadecandy board and into your computer\n",
    "1. Gently plug the 5V power supply into an outlet\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Fadecandy Software\n",
    "1. Open this link: [https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy](https://github.com/scanlime/fadecandy) and click the green \"Clone or download\" button. From the drop down menu, click \"Download ZIP\". Download this zip file (fadecandy-master.zip) to your computer.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/labs/figures/fc_sw_link.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "1. Extract the downloaded zip file fadecandy-master.zip\n",
    "1. Open the extracted folder fadecandy-master\n",
    "1. Open the fadecandy-master\\bin directory\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/labs/figures/fc_bin_folder.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "1. Run the fcserver program. This program runs in the background and connects your Python code with the Fadecandy board. It also has a simple web interface you can use to test your LEDs.\n",
    "    1. On Mac OS, double-click the fcserver-osx file in bin\n",
    "    1. On Windows, double-click fcserver.exe in bin\n",
    "1. Check that fcserver is running. The fcserver program will run in a terminal window (console). If all is well, you should get a message like \"Server listening on 127.0.0.1:7890\". This tells you it's ready to accept connections from other programs on your computer.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/labs/figures/fc_server_console.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "What is fcserver listening for? Three things, actually:\n",
    "    1. Programs using the Open Pixel Control (opc) protocol to talk to your LEDs\n",
    "        1. This is how we are going to program the Fadecandy/matrix using Python\n",
    "    1. Browser-based programs using WebSockets to talk to your LEDs\n",
    "    1. Web browsers requesting an HTML-based user interface\n",
    "1. Let's try out the browser interface. Now that fcserver is running, you can navigate your web browser to [http://localhost:7890](http://localhost:7890). You should see a page like this one:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/labs/figures/fc_server_web.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "    1. If you plug in a Fadecandy Controller board, it should show up in the Connected Devices section. No need to reload the web page.\n",
    "    1. From the \"Test Patterns\" drop down button, select 50% brightness to make sure you are all set up to connect to your Fadecandy and matrix! If this doesn't work, ask your TA for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run a Fadecandy Python Example\n",
    "We are (finally) going to program the Fadecandy/matrix from Python! To do this, follow these steps:\n",
    "1. Navigate up one directory from the fadecandy-master\\bin folder to the fadecandy-master folder. Open the fadecandy-master\\examples\\python folder. Here you will see several .py file examples\n",
    "1. Open the README.md file using a text editor. README.md contains a description of each .py file in the folder. Read about chase.py. **When executed, what is chase.py supposed to do?**\n",
    "1. Open chase.py in Spyder\n",
    "1. Run chase.py and watch your matrix! **Does the execution of chase.py do what you expected it to do?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's walk through chase.py line by line (I've added line numbers):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Line 1:#!/usr/bin/env python\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 3:# Light each LED in sequence, and repeat.\n",

    "Line 15:\t\ttime.sleep(0.01)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 5: `opc` (you can read about what opc does in README.md) and `time` are imported. The `opc` module is imported in order to create a `Client` object used to interface with the hardware via the fcserver (see line 8). The `time` module is imported to add a time delay, essentially forcing the program to \"wait\" (see line 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 7: a variable `numLEDS` is initialized to 512. Some Fadecandy projects connect to 8x64 LED NeoPixel matrices. Since we are connected to a 8x8 matrix, what should we change `numLEDS` to? Make this change and re-run chase.py. **How did this change affect the animation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 8: an `opc.Client` object is initialized. If you are curious about the string argument, `'localhost:7890'`, read about it in the docstring of `__init__()` in opc.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 10: we have an infinite loop. Essentially, run until this program is killed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 11: we have a loop iterating `numLEDS` number of times. For each iteration, `i`, of the loop (lines 11-15), the code does the following:\n",
    "1. Line 12: Create a list of `numLEDS` RGB (R, G, B) tuples. *A tuple is an immutable list*. Each tuple is initialized to (0, 0, 0) which is black (no light). A list of pixel colors is created for each light.\n",
    "1. Line 13: Modify the RGB tuple to (255, 255, 255), which is white. Try changing the tuple to (151, 30, 49) **How did this change affect the animation?** \n",
    "    1. Do you know what color (151, 30, 49) is? Hint: GO COUGS!\n",
    "1. Line 14: Send the pixel colors to the hardware. `put_pixels()` is a *method* of the `Client` object. Recall, **what is a method?**\n",
    "1. Line 15: Suspend the program a certain number of seconds. `time.sleep(<number of seconds>`) accepts an argument, the number of seconds to \"wait\". You can read more about `time.sleep()` in the [Python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/time.html#time.sleep). Change the 0.01 to 1 and re-run chase.py. **How did this change affect the animation?**\n",
