    "At the conclusion of this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Open and close files\n",
    "* Read and write files\n",
    "* Utilize file objects\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Use `while`, `for`, and nested loops to repeat a sequence of Python statements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Format\n",
    "#### Task 0 and Pair Task\n",

    "#### Additional Tasks\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2016/cpts111/home) lab section group.

    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",

    "* Work on additional tasks\n",

    "1. Fill the staircase with integers representing the current floor.\n",
    "2. Solve the problem using nested loops instead of using the string repetition operator *\n",
