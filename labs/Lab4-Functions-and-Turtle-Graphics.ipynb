    "### Learner Objectives\n",
    "At the conclusion of this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Use Turtle graphics\n",
    "* Define and call functions that execute Turtle graphics code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before starting this lab, participants should be able to:\n",
    "* Call standard Python functions\n",
    "* Define functions\n",
    "* Call programmer-defined functions\n",
    "* Pass arguments into functions\n",
    "* Return values from functions\n",

    "### Lab Format\n",
    "#### Task 0 and Pair Task\n",
    "Task 0 will be completed as a group with step-by-step guidance from your TA. After Task 0, your TA will group you into pairs and assign you a task (one of Tasks 1-10).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Tasks\n",
    "Once you complete Task 0 and your assigned task with a partner (pair task), you are to continue solving additional lab tasks until the end of lab. You are encouraged to complete *all* of the lab tasks. Practice, practice, practice! \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/spring2017/cpts111/home) lab section group. Helping your peers benefits both you and your classmates, as Albert Einstein said, \"You do not really understand something unless you can explain it to your grandmother.\" :)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lab Dismissal\n",
    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",
    "* Help your peers\n",
    "* Work on additional tasks\n",

    "For this task (and other tasks in this lab), we are going to use the [Turtle graphics](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html) module. Imagine a turtle standing at the origin (0,0) of an x-y canvas. For fun, let's name this turtle Crush (from Finding Nemo):\n",

Take a moment and read through the list of available turtle commands [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html#overview-of-available-turtle-and-screen-methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some common turtle methods (methods are functions that are associated with an object):\n",
    "1. `forward(<number of pixels)`: moves the turtle forward a specified number of pixels\n",
    "1. `backward(<number of pixels)`: moves the turtle backward a specified number of pixels\n",
    "1. `left(<number of degrees>)`: rotates the turtle counter clockwise a specified number of degrees\n",
    "1. `right(<number of degrees>)`: rotates the turtle clockwise a specified number of degrees\n",
    "1. `setpos(<x coordinate>, <y coordinate>)`: moves the turtle to the x, y coordinate arguments\n",
    "1. `speed(<integer speed>)`: increase the animation speed. An argument of 0 indicates the fastest drawing speed. See other speed options[here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html#turtle.speed)\n",
    "1. `penup()`: lifts the pen up so the turtle does not draw on the canvas when he/she moves\n",
    "1. `pendown()`: lowers the pen to the canvas so the turtle does draw when he/she moves\n",
    "1. `pencolor(<color string>)`: changes the pen color. See the available pen colors [here](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.4/TkCmd/colors.htm)\n",
    "1. `pensize(<integer width>)`: changes the pen size to the specified width\n",
    "1. `shape(<turtle string>)`: change the turtle \"cursor\". See the available shapes [here](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/turtle.html#turtle.shape)\n",
    "1. Much more!\n",

    "Here is example turtle code that moves Crush to coordinate (5, 20) and then draws a thick green line 200 pixels (steps) in length:"
