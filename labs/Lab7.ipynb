    "\n",
    "#### Completing a Task\n",
    "When you complete a task, show your TA your code and output. Also, help others with this task either in person or by answering questions in your [Piazza](http://piazza.com/wsu/fall2016/cpts111/home) lab section group.

    "You are dismissed from lab when your TA dismisses you, or after 3 hours, whichever comes first. Your TA will dismiss you once you have demonstrated mastery of the material (completed a certain number of tasks). Should you demonstrate mastery before the end of lab, you are encouraged to stay and perform a combination of the following:\n",
