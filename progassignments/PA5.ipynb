    "### Overview and Requirements\n",
    "Write a program (road_trip.py) that computes simple statistics about a road trip! To do this, we are going to use the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/web-services/overview). API stands for application programming interface. An API provides functions for programmers to use, without needing to know the details of the implementation. For example, Google Maps is a complex, well-tested program. We can use Google Maps via its API without knowing Google Map's details. This is also one of the beauties of functions. As long as we know:\n",
    "1. The name of the function to call\n",
    "1. What parameter(s) the functions expects\n",
    "1. What the function returns\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can use Google Maps!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Program Details\n",
    "Write a program that reads in US locations from an input file. The locations include a road trip origin (starting location), destination (ending location), and several road trip \"waypoints\" (stops in between the origin and destination). \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Input File Format\n",
    "The road trip file is a text file formatted such that it starts with the origin location and ends with the destination location. In between the origin and destination are waypoint/day pairs: one waypoint per line, immediately followed by the number of days spent at a waypoint on the next line. Waypoint/days spent pairs are separated from other waypoint/days spent pairs by a blank line. Here is an example with an origin (Seattle, WA), two waypoints (1 day spent in Portland, OR and 3 days spent in San Francisco, CA), and destination (San Diego, CA):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Seattle, WA\n",
    "\n",
    "Portland, OR\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    "San Francisco, CA\n",
    "3\n",
    "\n",
    "San Diego, CA\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example input file [florida_roadtrip.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/progassignments/files/florida_roadtrip.txt) that represents a roadtrip I took in 2012. The origin of this roadtrip is Spokane, WA and the destination is Gainesville, FL. There are 10 waypoints between Spokane and Gainesville. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The road trip input file will always have an origin, at least 1 waypoint, and a destination in it. Your code should handle *any number of waypoints between [1, 23] inclusive in the road trip file*; you are guaranteed there will be at least one waypoint in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Output\n",
    "The output of your program has two parts:\n",
    "1. Status messages *displayed to the console*. These messages simply let the user know what the program is currently computing (e.g. \"Reading in road trip origin location from florida_roadtrip.txt...\", etc.).\n",
    "1. Road trip information and statistics *written to an output file*. Name your output file `<input file base name>_stats.txt`. For example, for the provided input file, \"florida_roadtrip.txt\", the corresponding output file is \"florida_roadtrip_stats.txt\". The stats to be written to the output file include:\n",
    "    1. Distances in miles between each consecutive road trip stop. See the starter code below for how to get this information.\n",
    "    1. Total number of waypoints on the road trip.\n",
    "    1. Total number of days on the road trip.\n",
    "    1. Total miles traveled on the road trip.\n",
    "    1. Names of the two waypoints with the most distance between them and that distance in miles.\n",
    "    1. Name of the waypoint with the longest stay and its number of days.\n",
    "    1. Average miles between between each stop (including origin, waypoints, and destination).\n",
    "    1. Average number of days spent at each waypoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "All distances reported should be in miles and with two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The above stats are similar to the stats you computed for Lab 7 Task 2. The solution to this task is posted in Piazza."

    "### Bonus (10 pts)\n",
    "Using the [Google Maps Embed API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide), create a webpage containing an embedded Google Map for the road trip. For example, the webpage we are going to build for [florida_roadtrip.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/progassignments/files/florida_roadtrip.txt) looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/progassignments/figures/florida_roadtrip.png\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Setup\n",
    "To do the Bonus, you will need a free Google account and a free Google Maps API key:\n",
    "1. Go to the [Google Maps Embed API page](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide)\n",
    "1. Scroll down to the \"API Key\" section and click the blue \"Get a key\" button \n",
    "1. Create a new project\n",
    "1. Copy the API key. In your Python program, declare a variable called `api_key` to store your copied API key. \n",
    "    1. **Set `api_key` to an empty string before you submit your code to Blackboard.** The grader will use their own key to run your code.\n",
    "    1. Why remove your API key? Read Google's [\"Best practices for securing API keys\"](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6310037) page. The first bullet point reads: **\"Do not embed API keys directly in code\".** Storing your API key in a variable, `api_key` in your code is bad practice!! However, in CptS 111 it is \"okay\" because only you will have access to your key. If you are going to release your code to others (*after you finish CptS 111 because remember, you are not allowed to share your programming assignment code with others*) follow Google's [\"Best practices for securing API keys\"](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6310037). \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, read the [Google Maps Embed API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide), specifically read:\n",
    "1. Overview\n",
    "2. Forming the URL\n",
    "3. Directions mode (we will need to use the parameter `waypoints`)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus Coding Tasks\n",
    "Now, we are ready to write code! There are 3 coding tasks for the bonus:\n",
    "1. (3 pts) Build a string for the `waypoints` parameter according to the [Google Maps Embed API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide). While iterating through each waypoint in the input file, use the provided `format_city_string()` function from the starter code and the string concatenation operator to build a string for the waypoints parameter. For the [florida_roadtrip.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/progassignments/files/florida_roadtrip.txt) files, this string should look like the following (no spaces or newlines): \n",
    ">Yellowstone+National+Park+WY|Grand+Teton+National+Park+WY|Salt+Lake+City+UT|Bryce+Canyon+National+Park+UT|\n",
    "Grand+Canyon+AZ|Surprise+AZ|Carlsbad+Caverns+National+Park+NM|San+Antonio+TX|New+Orleans+LA|Panama+City+FL\n",
    "1. (4 pts) Write a function to build an `<iframe>` according to the [Google Maps Embed API documentation](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide). This function should accept the following arguments and return the `<iframe>` string:\n",
    "    1. A string representing the origin and formatted by `format_city_string()`\n",
    "    1. A string representing the destination and formatted by `format_city_string()` (from the starter code)\n",
    "    1. A string representing the `waypoints` parameter (built in the previous step)\n",
    "1. (3 pts) Write a function to write the `<iframe>` string to a file called `<input file base name>.html`. For example, for the provided input file, \"florida_roadtrip.txt\", the corresponding output file is \"florida_roadtrip.html\". Now, programmatically open a web browser to the html file you just created. Python makes this really simple to do! To open a webpage, we can import the `webbrowser` module and pass in a string argument representing the webpage:"
