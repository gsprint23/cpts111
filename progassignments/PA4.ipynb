    "### Overview and Requirements\n",
    "Write a program to play the game [Pass the Pigs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_Pigs) (pigs.py). Pass the Pigs is a popular games of chance for two or more players based on a dice game called [Pig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_(dice_game).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the game are straightforward. A player tosses two toy pigs, each of which has a dot on one side (see image below). Each pig can land in one of six positions:\n",
    "1. On its side\n",
    "    1. Side with dot down \n",
    "    1. Side with dot up\n",
    "1. Razorback (on its back)\n",
    "1. Trotter (on all four feet)\n",
    "1. Snouter (balanced on front two feet and its snout)\n",
    "1. Leaning jowler (balanced on one foot, snout, and ear)\n",
    "    * Note: This is extremely rare! See the table of position frequencies below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a Trotter (left pig) and a Snouter (right pig):\n",

    "\n",
    "After the pigs have come to rest, the player gains or loses points based on the way the pigs land:\n",
    "* Double (both pigs in the same position)\n",
    "    * Sider (either both with the spot facing upward or both with the spot facing downward): 1 point\n",
    "    * Double Razorback: 20 points\n",
    "    * Double Trotter: 20 points\n",
    "    * Double Snouter: 40 points\n",
    "    * Double Leaning Jowler: 60 points\n",
    "* Pig Out: 0 Points!! If both pigs are lying on their sides, one with the spot facing upwards and one with the spot facing downwards the score for that turn is reset to 0 and the turn changes to the next player\n",
    "* Mixed Combo: A combination not mentioned above is the sum of the single pigs' scores. Single pigs' scores:\n",
    "    * The pig is lying on its side: 0 points\n",
    "    * Razorback: 5 points\n",
    "    * Trotter: 5 points\n",
    "    * Snouter: 10 points\n",
    "    * Leaning Jowler: 15 points\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, in the image above, the pig on left is in the Trotter position and the pig on the right is in the Snouter position. This throw of the pigs is worth 5 + 10 = 15 points.\n",

    "Note: While there are a few more scoring combinations in the official Pass the Pigs game, we will only use the above combinations for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each player's turn continues until the player decides to stop their turn (accumulating points), or rolls a Pig Out. The player's score is updated and the turn is passed to the next player. The game ends when a player reaches a predetermined number of points (usually 100)."

    "### Program Details\n",
    "Write a program that implements Pass the Pigs for two players according to the above rules. Your program will prompt the user for the total number of points representing a winning score. The winning score should be an integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to 100. **Your program should validate the entered winning score is valid.** \n",
    "\n",
    "At a minimum, your solution must contain the functions below. These functions will help you get started!\n",
    "1. (5 pts) `display_game_rules()`: Prints out the rules of Pass the Pigs.  \n",
    "1. (10 pts) `get_valid_winning_score()`: Prompts the players (users) for the integer number of points to play until. The **validated** integer number of points is returned. *Calls `is_valid_winning_score(score)` to determine if the user-entered number of points is valid.*\n",
    "1. (5 pts) `is_valid_winning_score(score)`: Checks to see if the entered winning score is an integer > 0 and <= 100. This function is a *predicate* function:\n",
    "    * If the wager is in the range [1, 100] inclusive, then `True` is returned; otherwise `False` is returned.\n",
    "1. (10 pts) `roll_pig()`: Rolls one pig. This function should randomly generate a pig position using the frequencies listed in the table below. Returns a string representing the position of the rolled pig, one of:\n",
    "    * \"SIDE\" (for side without dot)\n",
    "    * \"SIDE-D\" (for side with dot)\n",
    "    * \"RZR\" (for razorback)\n",
    "    * \"TROT\" (for trotter)\n",
    "    * \"SNOUT\" (for snouter)\n",
    "    * \"LEAN\" (for leaning jowler)\n",
    "1. (10 pts) `determine_roll_result(pig1, pig2)`: Determines the roll result based on the two pigs' positions and returns a string representing the roll result (e.g. \"Sider\", \"Double razorback\", etc.).\n",
    "1. (10 pts) `calculate_total_roll_points(roll_result)`: Determines the total points rolled based on the both pigs' positions (`roll_result` e.g. \"Sider\", \"Double razorback, etc.) and returns the total points. \n",
    "1. (30 pts) `main()` and the definition of additional functions beyond than the ones listed above: Call the above functions in order to play the game. Break the problem into tasks and build your solution accordingly. You will be graded on your approach. Ask the instructor or your TA for help with this!\n",

    "#### Chatter Messages\n",
    "As the game progresses, print various \"chatter\" messages based on the number of rolls taken so far by the player, the current score, and whether or not the player just won his/her roll such as, \"Sorry, you rolled a Pig Out!\", or \"Oh, you're going for broke, huh?\", or \"Aw c'mon, take a chance!\", or \"You're up big, now is the time to cash in your points!\" \n",
