    "Write an \"are you a fan\" quiz program (quiz.py). The program will quiz the user on a topic of your choosing (keep the topic appropriate!!). For quiz ideas, check out [this website](http://www.allthetests.com/fan-quizzes-tests-Fantests.php).\n",

    "### Program Details\n",
    "Your quiz must contain 10 questions. These 10 questions include **at least 2 of each of the following different types of questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Multiple choice (5 options a-e)\n",
    "The user enters in a character \"a\" through \"e\" for their answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1) The population of Pullman is roughly what? Please enter a character a-e.\n",
    "a) 10k\n",
    "b) 20k\n",
    "c) 30k\n",
    "d) 40k\n",
    "e) 50k\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Numeric Response\n",
    "The user enters in a numeric response to an open ended question. I recommend prompting the user to enter an integer. If you choose to use floats, be specific to the user about how they should enter their response (i.e. rounded and/or a certain number of decimal places).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "How many students are enrolled in this class? Please enter an integer.\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### True/False (Boolean)\n",
    "The user enters 1 or 0 in response to a statement. **Convert the string returned by `input()` into an integer, and then convert the integer into a Boolean with `bool()`. Then compare the `bool` response value to the reserved keywords `True` or `False`.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pullman used to be called \"Three Forks\", true or false? Please enter 1 for True or 0 for False.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional Requirements\n",
    "1. For each question:\n",
    "    1. **Define a function. The function should return the following**:\n",
    "        1. 1 (`int`) if the user answered correctly\n",
    "        1. 0 (`int`) if the user answered incorrectly\n",
    "    1. Explicitly tell the user the format in which they should enter their response. \n",
    "    1. Number each question.\n",
    "    1. Always tell the user if they answer correctly or incorrectly. \n",
    "        * If the user answered incorrectly, provide the correct answer.\n",
    "        * Use an `if-else` structure to do this.\n",
    "1. Define a `main()` function that drives your program. `main()` should count the number of correct answers (this is the user's quiz score).\n",
    "1. At the end of the quiz, tell the user their final score, plus a fun statement about how much of a \"fan\" they are of the quiz's topic (use an `if-elif-else` structure, which means you need at least 3 different fun statements based on the user's score)."

    "* 15 pts for correct `main()` function\n",
    "* 5 points for numbering questions and stating the response format in your question prompts\n",
    "* 5 points for letting the user know if they are correct and for providing the correct answer when they are wrong\n",
