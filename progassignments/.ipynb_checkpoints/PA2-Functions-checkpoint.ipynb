    "### Overview and Requirements\n",
    "Write a program (night_out.py) that simulates a night out on the town! The night out on the town is going to include that following activities (at a minimum):\n",
    "1. Dinner\n",
    "1. Concert\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: You can choose something other than a concert if you would like!\n",
    "\n",
    "The program will keep track of the amount of money spent for each activity (and associated car parking for the activity), including tax and tip where appropriate!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Details\n",
    "Write a program that prompts the user to enter the following information:\n",
    "1. State sales tax (percent)\n",
    "1. Price to park for dinner\n",
    "1. Price of meal *before tax*\n",
    "1. Dinner tip (percent)\n",
    "1. Price to park for the concert\n",
    "1. Price of the concert *before tax*\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of the program consists of the following:\n",
    "1. Total money spent for each activity (dinner tab and concert)\n",
    "1. Total money spent parking the user's car for the activities (dinner parking + concert parking)\n",
    "1. Total money spent for the night out\n",
    "\n",
    "Every money amount displayed to the user should have a dollar sign and be rounded to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Calculations\n",
    "1. Dinner\n",
    "    * The total tab for dinner includes the meal, tax, and the tip. The tip will be calculated based on the combined meal and tax total. \n",
    "    * The total tab for dinner should be **rounded *up* to nearest dollar**:\n",
    "    $$tab = \\lceil meal + tax + tip \\rceil$$\n",
    "        * Use the `ceil()` function from the `math` module to do this! \n",
    "        * See `round_up_to_nearest_dollar()` below.\n",
    "2. Concert\n",
    "    * The total cost for the concert includes the concert tickets and the tax.\n",

    "For this program, define the following functions:\n",
    "1. `display_instructions()`: Accepts no arguments. Prints instructions describing the use of the program to the user.\n",
    "1. `get_tax_percent()`: Accepts no arguments. Prompts the user for the state sales tax as a percent. Returns the sales tax percent.\n",
    "1. `get_tip_percent()`: Accepts no arguments. Prompts the user for what percentage of the bill (meal price + tax) they would like to tip. Returns the tip percent.\n",
    "1. `get_price(activity_label)`: Accepts 1 argument via the parameter `activity_label`, a string representing the price (before tax) to prompt the user for. Prompts the user to enter the price for `activity_label`. Returns a string representing the city.\n",
    "    * Example: `get_price(\"dinner\")` prompts the user with the string: \"How much does dinner cost before tax?\"\n",
    "1. `calculate_tax(price, tax_percent)`: Accepts 2 arguments via the parameters `price`, a float representing the cost of the activity and `tax_percent`, a float representing the sales tax percent. Computes the tax for `price` and returns the result as a floating point number.\n",
    "1. `calculate_tip(price, tip_percent)`: Accepts 2 arguments via the parameters `price`, a float representing the cost of the activity and `tip_percent`, a float representing the percentage the user would like to tip. Computes the tip for `price` and returns the result as a floating point number.\n",
    "1. `round_up_to_nearest_dollar(price)`: Accepts 1 argument via the parameter `price`, a float representing the cost of the activity. Rounds `price` to the nearest dollar and returns the result as a floating point number.\n",
    "1. `park_car()`: Accepts no arguments. Prompts the user for the cost to park their car and returns the result as a floating point number. Calls the following functions:\n",
    "    1. `get_price()`\n",
    "1. `go_to_dinner(tax_percent)`: Accepts 1 argument via the parameter `tax_percent`, a float representing the sales tax percent.

    "    1. `get_price()`\n",
    "    1. `calculate_tax()`\n",
    "1. `display_money_spent(dinner_spent, concert_spent, parking_spent)`: Accepts 3 arguments via the parameters `dinner_spent`, `concert_spent`, and `parking_spent`, which represent how much money the user spent on dinner, the concert, and parking, respectively. Displays the results.\n",
