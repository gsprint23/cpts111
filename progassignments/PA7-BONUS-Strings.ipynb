    "### Overview and Requirements\n",
    "Write a program (md_to_html.py) that converts the contents of a [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) file to a [HTML]() file. The output of your code will be this webpage: [personal_website.html](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/gsprint23/cpts111/blob/master/progassignments/files/personal_website.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML is characterized by tags, which are angle brackets < > used to \"label\" content. You have probably seen HTML before, maybe something like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h1>This is a header</h1>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, the text \"This is a header\" is labeled as a first (top) level header. \n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown is a lightweight markup language that is used by many sites, such as [Github](https://github.com/) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/commenting) for plain text formatting. For example, [Github](https://github.com/) uses Markdown to format [README](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/) files.  Like HTML, Markdown is used to build content for websites; however, Markdown is much easier to learn and simpler to read. For example, let's look at the previous HTML header example in Markdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "`# This is a header`\n",
    "\n",
    "The # symbol denotes a header, and the number of # symbols denotes a header level. For this assignment, we are only going to cover a handful of basic Markdown and HTML features. Beyond the scope of this assignment, if you want to learn more about HTML (and CSS and Javascript), I recommend starting with [this Codeacademy tutorial](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web). If you want to learn more about Markdown, I recommend starting with [this Markdown tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Program Details\n",
    "Write a program that reads the contents of a Markdown file (.md file) as input, and produces an HTML file (.html file) as output. In addition, your program should also include status messages *displayed to the console*. These messages simply let the user know what the program is currently computing (e.g. \"Reading in website information from personal_website.md...\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markdown/HTML Background Info\n",
    "##### Headers in Markdown\n",
    "Headers are used to label a section. There are 6 different levels of headers:\n",
    "# Header Level 1\n",
    "## Header Level 2\n",
    "### Header Level 3\n",
    "#### Header Level 4\n",
    "##### Header Level 5\n",
    "###### Header Level 6\n",
    "Each header (except for level 1) represents a sub section of previous, higher level headers. \n",
    "\n",
    "A phrase in Markdown is specified as a header by beginning with the # symbol. The number of # symbols denotes the level of the header. For example, a level 3 header in Markdown: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "### This is a level 3 header\n",
    "```\n",
    "would be displayed in a browser as:\n",
    "### This is a level 3 header\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Headers in HTML\n",
    "A phrase in HTML is specified as a header by beginning with the `<h1>` tag for a header level 1 and ending with the `</h1>` tag. The number of after the \"h\" in the tag denotes the level of the header. For example, a level 3 header in HTML: \n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<h3>This is a level 3 header</h3>\n",
    "```\n",
    "would be displayed in a browser as:\n",
    "### This is a level 3 header\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unordered Lists in Markdown\n",
    "Preface each item in an unordered list (bulleted list) with a `*`. Place each item on its own line. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Item1\n",
    "* Item2\n",
    "* Item3\n",
    "```\n",
    "would be displayed in a browser as:\n",
    "* Item1\n",
    "* Item2\n",
    "* Item3\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unordered Lists in HTML\n",
    "Begin an unordered list in HTML with the tag `<ul>` and end the list with the tag `</ul>`. In between these tags, preface each item in an unordered list with the tag `<li>` (short for list item) and end the list item with the tag `</li>`. For example:\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Item1</li>\n",
    "<li>Item2</li>\n",
    "<li>Item3</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "```\n",
    "would be displayed in a browser as:\n",
    "* Item1\n",
    "* Item2\n",
    "* Item3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Images in Markdown\n",
    "To include an image in Markdown, we need to specify a link to the image. For example, to insert an image from [https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png) add an exclamation mark and a set of angle brackets in front of the url in parenthesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "`![](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)` \n",
    "would be displayed in a browser as:\n",
    "![](https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Images in HTML\n",
    "To include an image in HTML, like Markdown we need to specify a link to the image with the `<img>` tag. Using the same example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`<img src=\"https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png\">`\n",
    "would be displayed in a browser as:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Additional HTML Code to Add\n",
    "To make our personal website look \"semi-fancy\", your HTML file should include the following string as the *header* (top of the file):\n",
    "\n",
    "```html\n",
    "<!DOCTYPE html>\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "<head>\n",
    "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://s3.amazonaws.com/codecademy-content/courses/ltp/css/bootstrap.css\">\n",
    "<link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"http://www.wsulibs.wsu.edu/sites/all/themes/wsulibtest/favicon.ico\" type=\"image/vnd.microsoft.icon\" />\n",
    "<title>Personal Website</title>\n",
    "</head>\n",
    "<body>\n",
    "<div class=\"container\">\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And the following string as the *trailer* (end of the file):\n",
    "```html\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "</body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply write the above information to the output file in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions to Define\n",
    "You are free to decide which functions to define to solve this problem. Break the problem into tasks and build your solution accordingly. You will be graded on your approach. Ask the instructor or your TA for help with this!"
