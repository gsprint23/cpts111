    "#### PPM Image Format\n",
    "The PPM image format is encoded in human-readable plain text. A PPM image has two main parts:\n",
    "1. Header\n",
    "1. Body\n",
    "\n",
    "##### PPM Header\n",
    "The header is always the top three uncommented lines in the file:\n",
    "```\n",
    "P3\n",
    "4 4\n",
    "255\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first line specifies the image encoding that is contained within the file. We will always use the \"P3\" specification. The second line specifies the number of pixel columns and rows present in the image. In this example, we have a 4 pixel by 4 pixel image. The final number indicates the maximum value for each red, green, and blue (RGB) element in the picture. We will always use a max value of 255. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### PPM Body\n",
    "Below the header is the body of the PPM file. Each pixel has a red, green, and blue value. For example, the body content of our 4x4 image might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "255 0   0       0   255 0      0   0   255    255 255 255\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With these values, the pixel in the first column and first row has a RGB value of (255, 0, 0), which equates to red. The pixel in the last column and the first row has a RGB value of (255, 255, 255), which equates to white. A blown-up image containing these values would look like:\n",

    "### Program Details\n",
    "Write a program to prompt the user for the name of an input PPM image. Produce an output PPM image file for each of the following modifications to the input PPM image:\n",
    "1. Flip the image vertically\n",
    "1. Flip the image horizontally\n",
    "1. Remove a primary color (red, green, blue)\n",
    "1. Negate the colors\n",
    "1. Apply a high contrast\n",
    "1. Add random noise\n",
    "1. Apply a gray scale\n",
    "1. (Bonus) Apply a horizontal blur\n",
    "\n",
    "Provide status updates to the console regarding your program's progress applying the above modifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Required Data Structure\n",
    "In your program, the PPM image data must be stored in a 2-dimensional list (pixel rows and columns) of tuples. Each tuple represents an RGB triple, e.g. (red value, green value, blue value).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functions to Define\n",
    "At a minimum, your solution must contain the functions below. These functions will help you get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "Required *file I/O* functions:\n",
    "1. `process_header(infile, outfile)`: Accepts input and output file objects. Writes the first three lines of the input image to the output image (no need to modify these lines)\n",
    "1. `process_body(infile, outfile, modification)`:  Accepts an input file object, output file object, and a string representing the modification to apply. Calls `load_image_data()` and calls the appropriate function to apply the specified modification according to `modification`. \n",
    "1. `load_image_data(infile)`: Accepts an input file object. Reads the data in from the input PPM image into a 2-dimensional list of RGB tuples. Returns the 2-dimensional list.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Required *image modification* functions:\n",
    "1. `apply_vertical_flip(image_2dlist, outfile)`: Accepts a 2-dimensional list of tuples and an output file object. Flips the image data in `image_2dlist` vertically. \n",
    "1. `apply_horizontal_flip(image_2dlist, outfile)`: Accepts a 2-dimensional list of tuples and an output file object. Flips the image data in `image_2dlist` horizontally. \n",
    "1. (Bonus) `apply_horizontal_blur(image_2dlist, outfile)`: Accepts a 2-dimensional list of tuples and an output file object. Horizontally blurs the image data in `image_2dlist`. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Required *RGB tuple/value* modification functions:\n",
    "1. `negative(num)`: Accepts a *single* integer RGB value. Subtracts 255 and takes the absolute value of the result. Returns the modified value.\n",
    "1. `high_contrast(num)`: Accepts a *single* integer RGB value. If the value is greater than 127, sets it to 255, otherwise sets it to 0. Returns the modified value.\n",
    "1. `random_noise(num)`: Accepts a *single* integer RGB value. Generates a random number in the range [-50, 50] and adds it to the value. Returns the modified value.\n",
    "1. `gray_scale(rgb)`: Accepts a RGB tuple. Computes the average of the RGB values in the tuple. Returns a new tuple with each RGB value is the average.\n",
    "1. `remove_color(rbg, color_to_remove)`: Accepts a RGB tuple and a string representing the color to remove (e.g. \"r\", \"g\", or \"b\"). Returns a new tuple with the appropriate red, green, or blue value set to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `main()` function that drives your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mini Modification Examples (To Help Understand the Problem)\n",
    "Negative line example: `1 2 3 200 100 150` negated is `254 253 252 55 155 105`\n",
    "\n",
    "High contrast line example: `1 2 3 200 100 150` in high contrast is `0 0 0 255 0 255`\n",
    "\n",
    "Gray scale line example: `1 2 3 200 100 150` as gray scale is `2 2 2 150 150 150`.\n",
