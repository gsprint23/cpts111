    "### Python\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s. It is an open source, general-purpose language. It is flexible and powerful, yet still simple enough to be quickly picked up by new programmers. Python is fairly high on the high-level programming languages spectrum, meaning its syntax and grammar is fairly close to pseudo-code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python can be run on any computer architecture, so long as a Python interpreter is installed on the machine. This is similar to Java in the sense that as long as Java (more specifically, a Java Virtual Machine) is installed on your computer (you've seen the pesky Java update dialogs), you can run Java code written on any other architecture. It is convenient, cross-platform approach to application development. In contrast to *interpreted languages*, *compiled languages* are translated into specific computer architecture machine code (i.e. for a specific Intel processor instead of an AMD processor). Interpreted languages, such as Python and Java, tend to run slower than compiled languages, such as C and Fortran. \n",

    "### Integrated Development Environments (IDE)\n",
    "An IDE is a program we use to write other programs. It conveniently combines editing of source code with running your program.\n",
    "* Generally a single button will start the translation process\n",
    "\n",
    "IDEs provide a variety of tools to assist programmers, for example:\n",
    "* Source code syntax highlighting\n",
    "* Autocompletion lists (\"Intellisense\")\n",
    "* A debugger, which allows a programmer to step through programs, one instruction at a time\n",
    "* A testing framework for developing unit tests\n",
    "\n",
    "### Executing Programs\n",
    "In this class, programs will execute in a text-based window called a console\n",
    "* Input data can be entered at command-line prompts\n",
    "* Output results will be displayed in the console window\n",
    "\n",
