    "### Defining a Function\n",
    "A *function definition* specifies the name of the function and the statements to be executed when the function is \"called\". We call a program by its name when we want to run it. A function definition follows the general template:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def <function_name>(input parameters)\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    docstring\n",

    "    executable statements\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    return <output parameters>\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are several aspects of a function to note:\n",
    "* `def` is a keyword that let's Python know you are about to declare a function\n",
    "* The function name should follow similar naming conventions and style guidelines as variable names. Note that function names are user-defined identifiers and should not redefine standard-identifiers (e.g. built-in functions) or previously declared user-identifiers (e.g. your own variables you've already declared).\n",
    "* The input parameters represent data coming in to your function. Don't forget the colon after the last paren.\n",
    "* Together, `def`, function name, and input parameters form the *function header*\n",
    "* The remaining portion of the function is called the *function body*. **All statements of the function body should be indented 4 spaces**. Indentation is how Python *groups* the code you've written with the function header to collectively form the *function definition*.\n",
    "* A multi-line comment, called a docstring, immediately follows the function header. This is where you explain what the function does, what inputs it expects, what outputs it produces, what assumptions the function makes, etc. When you type `help(<function_name>)`, the text in the docstring is what shows up (cool!).\n",
    "* Following the docstring are one or more executable statements.\n",
    "* `return` statements specify the output parameters (results) of your function. Although you can have multiple return statements, in this class we will typically only have one (good style usually dictates only having one return statement per function anyways)."
