    "## Storing Data\n",
    "Many applications require storing and retrieving data outside of a program. Think of the many different applications you regularly use, do they utilize information that has been saved in some way?\n",
    "* PC: Your operating system stores all of your settings, files, and machine state for you.\n",
    "* Banks: Every customer's transaction history is stored in massive databases in data warehouses. When you make a debit purchase, your account balance is retrieved from one of these servers to make sure you have enough money for your transaction. (`if balance >= purchase`)\n",
    "* Games: Your progress in a game is stored in a file so that when you turn off your console (or laptop), your progress isn't lost.\n",
    "<img src=\"https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/9d/d4/4f/9dd44f90ec89ca27594bc9036f16ab40.jpg\" width=350>\n",
    "* Search history: Websites save your recent searches in order to try and learn about your preferences and better predict what you will search for in the future.\n",
    "* Authentication: When you authorize an app to \"keep you logged in\", a token is being persistently stored by the app as your authentication so you don't have to type your username and password in each time.\n",
    "* Obviously many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Files\n",
    "A simple way to store data is in a *text file*, such as this simple text file, [transactions.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gsprint23/cpts111/master/lessons/files/transactions.txt), that stores an individual's credit card transaction history. Each line in the file represents a transaction price.\n",
    "\n",
    "To process data in a file, we typically take the following approach:\n",
    "1. Open the file\n",
    "1. Process the file\n",
    "    * Read data (doesn't modify the file) or\n",
    "    * Write data (overwrite existing file) or\n",
    "    * Append data (retains existing information and adds new data)\n",
    "1. Close the file\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "Before we can read from a file or write to a file, we first need to open the file and get a file object (AKA handle). We do this with the built-in function `open()`:"

    "#### File Modes\n",
    "The first argument to `open()` is a string representing the path to the file and the second argument is the file opening *mode*: \n",
    "1. \"r\" for reading\n",
    "    1. File must exist or you will get an error\n",
    "1. \"w\" for writing\n",
    "    1. If the file does not exist, it is created\n",
    "    1. If the file does exist, it is cleared!\n",
    "1. \"a\" is for appending\n",
    "    1. If the file does not exist, it is created\n",
    "    1. If the file does exist, new data written to the file is added at the end of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about modes [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files). \n",
    "\n",
    "`open()` returns an object that represents the connection between our program and transactions.txt.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Paths\n",
    "The directory (or folder) where your Python script is running is called the *current directory*. When you open a file, Python looks for it in the current directory. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a file you want to open is in a directory other than the current directory, you will have to specify its path. The location of a file is represented by its path, the sequence of folders that the file is stored in, plus the file's name. There are two ways to specify a path:\n",
    "1. Relative path: a path to a file or directory relative to the current directory. For example: \"files\\transactions.txt\" refers to a file (\"transactions.txt\") in a directory (\"files\") in the current directory.\n",
    "1. Absolute path: a path to a file or directory specified by its exact location on your file system. For example: \"C:\\Users\\gsprint\\cpts111\\lessons\\files\\transactions.txt\" refers to a file (\"transactions.txt\") in the folder \"C:\\Users\\gsprint\\cpts111\\lessons\\files\" on my C:\\ drive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: On a windows machine, folders and file names in a path are separated by backslashes \"\\\". We know the backslash has a special purpose in Python, to escape certain characters, such as a newline \"\\n\"; therefore, you will have to escape a backslash: \"`\\\\`\" in your path to a file: `\"files\\\\transactions.txt\"`. Alternatively, you can specify your path as a raw string: `r\"files\\transactions.txt\"`. On a Unix-based machine (e.g. Mac, Linux distributions), the forward slash \"/\" is used in paths and you don't have to worry about this issue.\n",
