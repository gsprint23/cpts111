    "## Programming Errors\n",
    "Rarely will you write a program that is free of errors. You'll need to diagnose and correct three kinds of errors:\n",
    "1. Syntax errors (code violates syntax rules for a proper Python program)\n",
    "    * Detected at compile time\n",
    "    * Program will not run unless they're corrected\n",
    "    * Examples\n",
    "        * Undeclared identifiers\n",
    "        * Invalid identifiers (e.g. a space in a variable name)\n",
    "        * Failure to close a comment or string properly\n",
    "        * Incorrect indenting (we will learn about indenting when we learn about functions)\n",
    "2. Run-time errors\n",
    "    * Cause the program to \"crash\": an error is reported, and control is turned over to the operating system\n",
    "    * Examples\n",
    "        * Division by zero\n",
    "        * Getting into an infinite loop, which may ultimately cause a \"stack overflow\"\n",
    "3. Logic Errors\n",
    "    * Cause the program to compute incorrect results\n",
    "    * Often go unnoticed, at least at first\n",
    "    * Examples\n",
    "        * Your algorithm is wrong because you misunderstand the problem\n",
    "        * You do not obtain input data properly, so your computations work on the wrong data."
