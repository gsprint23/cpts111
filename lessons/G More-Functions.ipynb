    "A commonly used method to provide a *rough* estimate of the right length of snowboard for a rider is to calculate 88 percent of their height. Write a program that will help people estimate the length of snowboard they should buy. Obtain the user's height in feet and inches (assume these values will be entered as integers) and display the length of snowboard in centimeters to the user. Note: There are 2.54 centimeters in an inch.\n",

    "1. `get_user_height()`: Returns the user's total height in inches.\n",
    "1. `convert_inches_to_centimeters(inches)`: Returns `inches` in centimeters.\n",
